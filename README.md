A web application developed in python and flask library. 
We aim to create a safe second hand selling platorm for UNCC. 


To run our website complete the following task

Download the git repo into a folder and open that folder in a terminal.
You need to make sure you have python downloaded and installed on your computer 
once in the repo folder run the comman python3 -m venv venv
then /source/bin/activate
once that is complete you should see "(venv)" pop up and now you run 
pip install -r requirements.txt
after a series of downloads occurs you can then run the final command 
python app.py
this will then run a series of commands and will see alot of outputs but the website should be avalible to you at localhost:5000
